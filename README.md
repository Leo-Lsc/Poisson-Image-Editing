# Poisson Image Editing
A Poisson image editing module was constructed using Python, NumPy, SciPy and OpenCV tool libraries. The module is able to achieve seamless fusion of source and target images, while improving the efficiency and performance of image processing through optimisation algorithms and sparse matrix processing.
